raction (prostaglandin), that stimulates contractions of the uterus. Within two weeks, the woman will expel the contents of her uterus, ending the pregnancy. A follow- up visit to the doctor is necessary to assure that the abortion is complete. With this procedure, a woman will feel cramping and may feel nauseated from the misoprostol. This combination of drugs is 90-96% effective in ending pregnancy. Mifepristone (RU-486), which goes by the brand name Mifeprex, works by blocking the action of prog- esterone, a hormone needed for pregnancy to continue, then stimulates uterine contractions thus ending the pregnancy. It can be taken a much as 49 days after the first day of a woman’s last period. On the first visit to the doctor, a woman takes a mifepristone pill. Two days later she returns and, if the miscarriage has not occurred, takes two misoprostol pills, which causes the uterus to contract. Five percent of women won’t need to take misoprostol. After an observation period, she returns home. Within four days, 90% of women have expelled the contents of their uterus and completed the abortion. Within 14 days, 95-97% of women have completed the abortion. A third follow-up visit to the doctor is neces- sary to confirm through observation or ultrasound that the procedure is complete. In the event that it is not, a surgical abortion is performed. Studies show that 4.5 to 8 percent of women need surgery or a blood transfusion after taking mifepristone, and the pregnancy persists in about 1 percent of women. In this case, surgical abortion is recommended because the fetus may be damanged. Side effects include nausea, vaginal bleeding and heavy cramping. The bleeding is typically heavier than a nor- mal period and may last up to 16 days. Mifepristone is not recommended for women with ectopic pregnancy, an IUD, who have been taking long- GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 210 Abortion, therapeutic Uterus Embryonic tissue Vagina Vulsellum Cervix Speculum Extraction tube Between 5
