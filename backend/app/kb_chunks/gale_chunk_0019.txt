eases, syphilis and conges- tive heart disease. Common bile duct —The branching passage through which bile—a necessary digestive enzyme—travels from the liver and gallbladder into the small intestine. Digestive enzymes from the pancreas also enter the intestines through the com- mon bile duct. Computed tomography scan (CT scan)—A special- ized type of x-ray imaging that uses highly focused and relatively low energy radiation to produce detailed two-dimensional images of soft tissue structures, particularly the brain. CT scans are the chief competitor to ultrasound and can yield higher quality images not disrupted by bone or gas. They are, however, more cumbersome, time consuming and expensive to perform, and they use ionizing electromagnetic radiation. Doppler—The Doppler effect refers to the apparent change in frequency of sound wave echoes returning to a stationary source from a moving target. If the object is moving toward the source, the frequency increases; if the object is moving away, the frequen- cy decreases. The size of this frequency shift can be used to compute the object’s speed—be it a car on the road or blood in an artery. The Doppler effect holds true for all types of radiation, not just sound. Frequency—Sound, whether traveling through air or the human body, produces vibrations—mole- cules bouncing into each other—as the shock wave travels along. The frequency of a sound is the num- ber of vibrations per second. Within the audible range, frequency means pitch—the higher the fre- quency, the higher a sound’s pitch. Ionizing radiation—Radiation that can damage liv- ing tissue by disrupting and destroying individual cells at the molecular level. All types of nuclear radiation—x rays, gamma rays and beta rays—are potentially ionizing. Sound waves physically vibrate the material through which they pass, but do not ionize it. Jaundice—A condition that results in a yellow tint to the skin, eyes and body fluids. Bile retention in the liver, gallbladder and
