Description Physical abuse of a child is the infliction of injury by an other person. The injuries can include punching, kick- ing, biting, burning, beating, or pulling the victim’s hair. The physical abuse inflicted on a child can result in bruises , burns, poisoning , broken bones, and internal hemorrhages. Physical assault against an adult primarily occurs with women, usually in the form of domestic vio- lence. It is estimated that approximately three million children witness domestic violence every year. Sexual abuse of a child refers to sexual behavior between an adult and child or between two children, one of whom is dominant or significantly older. The sexual behaviors can include touching breasts, genitals, and but- tocks; either dressed or undressed. The behavior can also include exhibitionism, cunnilingus, fellatio, or penetra- tion of the vagina or anus with sexual organs or objects. Pornographic photography is also used in sexual abuse with children. Reported sex offenders are 97% male. Females are more often perpetrators in child-care settings, since children may confuse sexual abuse by a female with normal hygiene care. Sexual abuse by step- fathers is five times more common than with biological fathers. Sexual abuse of daughters by stepfathers or fathers is the most common form of incest. Sexual abuse can also take the form of rape. The legal definition of rape includes only slight penile pene- tration in the victim’s outer vulva area. Complete erec- tion and ejaculation are not necessary. Rape is the perpe- tration of an act of sexual intercourse whether: • will is overcome by force or fear (from threats or by use of drugs).
