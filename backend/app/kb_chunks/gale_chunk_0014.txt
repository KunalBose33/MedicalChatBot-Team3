en. Because ultrasound can distinguish subtle variations between soft, fluid-filled tissues, it is particularly useful in providing diagnostic images of the abdomen. Ultrasound can also be used in treatment. Purpose The potential medical applications of ultrasound were first recognized in the 1940s as an outgrowth of the sonar technology developed to detect submarines during World War II. The first useful medical images were pro- duced in the early 1950s, and, by 1965, ultrasound quali- ty had improved to the point that it came into general medical use. Improvements in the technology, applica- tion, and interpretation of ultrasound continue. Its low cost, versatility, safety and speed have brought it into the top drawer of medical imaging techniques. While pelvic ultrasound is widely known and com- monly used for fetal monitoring during pregnancy , ultrasound is also routinely used for general abdominal imaging. It has great advantage over x-ray imaging tech- nologies in that it does not damage tissues with ionizing radiation. Ultrasound is also generally far better than plain x rays at distinguishing the subtle variations of soft tissue structures, and can be used in any of several modes, depending on the need at hand. As an imaging tool, abdominal ultrasound generally is warranted for patients afflicted with: chronic or acute abdominal pain; abdominal trauma; an obvious or sus- pected abdominal mass; symptoms of liver disease, pan- creatic disease, gallstones , spleen disease, kidney dis- ease and urinary blockage; or symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Specifically: • Abdominal pain. Whether acute or chronic, pain can signal a serious problem—from organ malfunction or injury to the presence of malignant growths. Ultrasound scanning can help doctors quickly sort through poten- tial causes when presented with general or ambiguous symptoms. All of the major abdominal organs can be studied for signs of disease that appear as changes in size, shape and internal
