the prognosis is excellent for the condition itself. The reason for the abscess (other diseases the patient has) will determine the overall outcome. If, on the other hand, the abscess ruptures into neighboring areas or permits the infectious GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 214 Abcess GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A 10/22/03 1:41 PM Page 14 agent to spill into the bloodstream, serious or fatal conse- quences are likely. Abscesses in and around the nasal sinuses, face, ears, and scalp may work their way into the brain. Abscesses within an abdominal organ such as the liver may rupture into the abdominal cavity. In either case, the result is life threatening. Blood poisoning is a term commonly used to describe an infection that has spilled into the blood stream and spread throughout the body from a localized origin. Blood poisoning, known to physicians as septicemia, is also life threatening. Of special note, abscesses in the hand are more seri- ous than they might appear. Due to the intricate structure and the overriding importance of the hand, any hand infection must be treated promptly and competently. Prevention Infections that are treated early with heat (if superfi- cial) or antibiotics will often resolve without the forma- tion of an abscess. It is even better to avoid infections altogether by taking prompt care of open injuries, partic- ularly puncture wounds. Bites are the most dangerous of all, even more so because they often occur on the hand. Resources BOOKS Bennett, J. Claude, and Fred Plum, eds. Cecil Textbook of Med- icine. Philadelphia: W. B.
