xit the uterus. Laminaria —A medical product made from a cer- tain type of seaweed that is physically placed near the cervix to cause it to dilate. Aftercare D&X typically does not require an overnight hospi- tal stay, so a follow up appointment may be scheduled to monitor the woman for any complications. Risks With all abortion, the later in pregnancy an abortion is performed, the more complicated the procedure and the greater the risk of injury to the woman. In addition to associated emotion reactions, D&X carries the risk of injury to the woman, including heavy bleeding, blood clots, damage to the cervix or uterus, pelvic infection, and anesthesia-related complications. There is also a risk of incomplete abortion, meaning that the fetus is not dead when removed from the woman’s body. Possible long-term risks include difficulty becoming pregnant or carrying a future pregnancy to term. Normal results The expected outcome of D&X is the termination of a pregnancy with removal of a dead fetus from the woman’s body.
