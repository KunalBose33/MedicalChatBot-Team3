ng fetuses should be counseled prior to the procedure. Individuals should receive infor- mation regarding the risks of a multi-fetal pregnancy to both the fetuses and the mother compared with the risks after the reduction. Individuals seeking an abortion for any reason should consider the ethical implications whether it be because the fetus is not the preferred sex or because the fetus would be born with a severe birth defect. Aftercare Counseling should continue after the abortion because it is a traumatic event. Individuals may feel guilty about choosing one fetus over another. Mental health professionals should be consulted throughout the process. Risks About 75% of women who undergo selective reduc- tion will go into premature labor . About 4-5% of women undergoing selective reduction also miscarry one or more of the remaining fetuses. The risks associated with multi-fetal pregnancy is considered higher. Normal results In cases where a multi-fetal pregnancy, three or more fetuses, is reduced to two, the twin fetuses typically develop as they would as if they were conceived as twins.
