escape either through a drainage tube or by leaving the cavity open to the skin. How big the incision is depends on how quickly the pus is encountered. Once the abscess is opened, the doctor will clean and irrigate the wound thoroughly with saline. If it is not too large or deep, the doctor may simply pack the abscess wound with gauze for 24–48 hours to absorb the pus and discharge. If it is a deeper abscess, the doctor may insert a drainage tube after cleaning out the wound. Once the tube is in place, the surgeon closes the incision with simple stitch- es, and applies a sterile dressing. Drainage is maintained for several days to help prevent the abscess from reforming. Preparation The skin over the abscess will be cleansed by swab- bing gently with an antiseptic solution. Aftercare Much of the pain around the abscess will be gone after the surgery. Healing is usually very fast. After the tube is taken out, antibiotics may be continued for sever- al days. Applying heat and keeping the affected area ele- vated may help relieve inflammation. Risks If there is any scarring, it is likely to become much less noticeable as time goes on, and eventually almost invisible. Occasionally, an abscess within a vital organ (such as the brain) damages enough surrounding tissue that there is some permanent loss of normal function. Normal results Most abscesses heal after drainage alone; others require drainage and antibiotic drug treatment. Resources BOOKS Turkington, Carol A., and Jeffrey S. Dover. Skin Deep.
